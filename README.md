# Predictive text tutorial

[Allison Parrish](http://www.decontextualize.com/)

This is a notebook I use when teaching classes and workshops. It explains a bit
about how Markov chains work and shows you how to use
[Markovify](https://github.com/jsvine/markovify) in Python.

If you don't have Python on your computer, you can use the link below to access
the code on Binder:

Note: Previous versions of this notebook gave a short example of writing
predictive text with [textgenrnn](https://github.com/minimaxir/textgenrnn).
I've subsequently started using the [aitextgen](https://github.com/minimaxir/aitextgen)
[Google Colab
notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/15qBZx5y9rdaQSyWpsreMDnTiZ5IlN0zD?usp=sharing)
for in-class tutorials on neural network-generated text.
